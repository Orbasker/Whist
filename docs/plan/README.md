## Phase Overview

### Phase 1: Current Scope (Single Game, Backend)
**Goal**: Build complete application with FastAPI backend, Angular web, and Flutter mobile

**Features**:
- ✅ Single game per session
- ✅ FastAPI backend with MVVM architecture
- ✅ Angular web application
- ✅ Flutter mobile application
- ✅ Scoring logic (no card dealing)
- ✅ Hebrew RTL support
- ✅ Dark theme with orange accents

**Technology Stack**:
- Backend: FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + PostgreSQL/SQLite
- Frontend: Angular 18+ (web) + Flutter 3.x (mobile)
- Database: PostgreSQL (prod) / SQLite (dev)

### Phase 2: Multi-User, Real-Time, Game Sharing (Future)
**Goal**: Add multi-user support, game sharing, and real-time updates

**Features**:
- 🔄 Multiple games per user
- 🔄 User authentication (provider TBD)
- 🔄 Game sharing with share codes
- 🔄 Real-time updates (WebSockets)
- 🔄 Row Level Security (RLS)
- 🔄 Multiple game groups

**Technology Additions**:
- Authentication: Supabase/Firebase/Auth0 (TBD)
- Real-time: FastAPI WebSockets or Supabase Realtime
- RLS: Database-level security policies

### Phase 3: Full Card Game Simulation (Future)
**Goal**: Add full card game mechanics with remote play

**Features**:
- 🔮 Card shuffling and dealing
- 🔮 Remote play (full game remotely)
- 🔮 Scoring-only mode (Phase 1 functionality)
- 🔮 Card game mechanics (play cards, track tricks)

**Technology Additions**:
- Card game engine
- Trick tracking system
- Game mode selection

## Architecture Highlights

### Backend (FastAPI with MVVM)

```
Models (M)      → SQLAlchemy ORM (database entities)
ViewModels (VM) → Pydantic schemas (request/response)
Views (V)       → FastAPI route handlers (API endpoints)
Services        → Business logic layer
Repositories    → Data access layer
```

### Frontend (Angular & Flutter)

```
Thin Clients → HTTP API calls → FastAPI Backend
                ↓
         Business Logic (Backend)
                ↓
         Database (PostgreSQL)
```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **UUID Primary Keys**: Forward compatible with multi-user scenarios
2. **Nullable Phase 2 Fields**: Backward compatible migration path
3. **JSON for Flexible Data**: Easy to extend without schema changes
4. **Separate Rounds Table**: Supports game history and future card data
5. **Extensible Enums**: Status and mode can be extended

## Quick Start Guide

### For Developers

1. **Read the migration plan**: `migration-to-angular-flutter.md`
2. **Understand the architecture**: `architecture.md`
3. **Review backend design**: `backend-architecture.md`
4. **Plan for future**: `future-phases.md`

### Implementation Order

1. **Phase 0**: Backend setup (FastAPI + MVVM)
2. **Phase 1**: Angular web application
3. **Phase 2**: Flutter mobile application
4. **Phase 3**: Polish & optimization

### Future Phases (Not in Current Scope)

- Phase 2: Multi-user features (see `future-phases.md`)
- Phase 3: Card game mechanics (see `future-phases.md`)
